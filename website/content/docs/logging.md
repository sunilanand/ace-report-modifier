## Overview

Ace prints a log of messages in a `ace.log` file located in an OS-specific directory:

- on Windows in `"%HOME%\AppData\Local\DAISY Ace\Log\"`
- on macOS in `"~/Library/Logs/DAISY\ Ace/"`
- on Linux in `"~/.local/state/DAISY Ace/"`

## Configuration

The logging level and the name of the log file can be configured through Aceâ€™s config file. Read more on [Ace configuration]({{< ref "config.md" >}}) to know more.
